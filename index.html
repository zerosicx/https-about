      <h1>HTTP(s)</h1>
      <em>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</em>
      <p> HTTP is a transfer protocol – set of rules for a procedure – concerned
        with the transportation of a web page across the internet. Web pages are
        files themselves and are contained in HTML documents for content, CSS for styling,
        and JavaScript documents for functionality.

      <p><em>To properly understand HTTP(s), we need to get acquainted with some terms first.
          <br>I'm also going to use a small website I created to demonstrate all the examples here.</em></p>
      <br>
      <h2>HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language</h2>
      <p>HTML Documents consist of bodies of <strong>text, images, videos, gifs,
          and other forms of media.</strong>
        When it was first created however, HTML only consisted of text. So, we’ve come a long way from 1993. Similarly, the first HTTP prototype
        released was in 1991! Currently we’re on HTML 5.
      </p>

      <h2>Protocol</h2>
      <p> A communication mechanism used to retrieve the resource.
        You could think of it as a <em>methodology</em> or a <em>way of doing
          something.</em> In this case, it is the way of transferring website
        building-blocks comprised of documents.</p>

      <hr>
      <h2>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</h2>
      <p>a URL is what we commonly know as the website name or domain. It’s been
        greatly simplified for everyday use, but we can break it down to
        understand how we see websites today. For example:</p>

      <picture>
        <source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="images/websiteAnnotation-small.png">
        <source media="(max-width: 1000px)" srcset="images/websiteAnnotation-medium.png">
        <source media="(max-width: 1200px)" srcset="images/websiteAnnotation-large.png">
        <img class="website-example-large centred-image" src="images/websiteAnnotation-large.png" alt="">
      </picture>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>HTTPS:</strong>the protocol for retrieving the website</li>
        <li><strong>The website domain:</strong> the name of the domain such as kmart.co.nz and github.io</li>
        <li><strong>Port:</strong> right after the domain name, a hidden protocol is there but does not need to be explicitly stated.</li>
        <li><strong>File path:</strong> the path in the file system of a webserver that leads to the file</li>
        <li><strong>File name</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <p> You may have noticed the protocol here is HTTPs rather than the standard
        HTTP. The “s” in HTTPs simply means <em><strong>secure. </strong></em>The whole of the internet has
        recently moved to this protocol.
      </p>

      <p>Secure <i class="fa-solid fa-lock"></i> means all our website traffic is encrypted. This makes it harder
        to track our data and identify us, and our location on the internet.
        For this reason, always make sure you’re on an HTTPs-employing website,
        or your data might just get compromised.</p>

      <p>One way we know is by seeing this little lock <i class="fa-solid fa-lock"></i> image on our search bars.</p>

      <hr>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Thus, HTTP is the method of communication between client (us) and server
        (website owner). We can technically be both the client and server as well,
        depending on if we decide to build our own website and put it on the
        network.</p>
